## Working with Covid-19 Data
This course focused on finding different types of data on a specific subject.

### Description
This project was about finding data from different sources and being able to clean, analyze, and combine all of the sources into one file. Since this was spring of 2020 it made sense to look at Covid-19 data as it was so new. One source could be a csv, the second source required me to scrape a website, and the third source had to be an API. 

### Main dataset
1. API - https://api.covid19api.com/summary
2. URL - https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries
3. CSV - corona_latest.csv

### Tools
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Html
